A shell utility is provided for saving invoice manually by increment id. 

Once installed go to backend in System > Configuration > Sales > Save Pdf Invoice to file system, here enable the extension and configure the path on server where pdf invoices will to be saved.

If the folder doesn't exists, the extension will create it. Be sure the parent location is accessibile and writable by magento.

The extension doesn't generate exception due to not impact the order flow, otherwise every action/error is logged in a separate log file in {{base_dir}}/var/log/Eg_SevInvoice.log .
